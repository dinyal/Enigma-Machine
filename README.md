You will find example plugboards, reflectors, and rotors in the folders specified, as .pb, .rf and .rot files. 

Usage: ./enigma plugboard-file reflector-file (<rotor-file>)* rotor-positions
  example: ./enigma plugboards/I.pb reflectors/I.rf rotors/I.rot rotors/II.rot rotors/III.rot rotors/I.pos
Note: .pos files in the rotors folder specify the starting position of each rotor.
